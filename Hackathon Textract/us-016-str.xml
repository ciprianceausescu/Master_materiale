                <content>A line of fixed length (usually 100 mm) with words that anchor the scale at the extreme ends
and no words describing intermediate positions. Patients are instructed to indicate the place
on the line corresponding to their perceived state. The mark’s position is measured as the
score.</content>

                <content>A VAS that has the addition of one or more intermediate marks positioned along the line with
reference terms assigned to eachmark to help patients identify the locations between the
scale’s ends (e.g., half-way).</content>

describes their state or experience. The ends of rating scales are anchored with words but the
categories are numbered rather than labeled with words.</content>

                <content>A set of pictures applied to any of the other response option types. Pictorial scales are often

                <content>Checklists provide a simple choice between a limited set of options, such asYes, No, and
Don’t know. Some checklists ask patients to place a mark in a space if the statement in the
item is true. Checklists are reviewed for completeness and nonredundancy.</content>
