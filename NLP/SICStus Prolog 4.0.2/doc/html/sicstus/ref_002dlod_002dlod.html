<h4 class="subsection">4.3.2 The Load Predicates</h4>

<p>Loading a program is accomplished by one of these predicates

     <dl>
<dt><code>[]</code><dt><code>[</code><var>:File</var><code>|</code><var>+Files</var><code>]</code><dt><code>load_files(</code><var>:Files</var><code>)</code><dt><code>load_files(</code><var>:Files</var><code>, </code><var>+Options</var><code>)</code><dd>loads source or PO file(s),
whichever is the more recent, according to <var>Options</var>.

     <br><dt><code>compile(</code><var>:File</var><code>)</code><dd>loads source file into virtual machine code.

     <br><dt><code>consult(</code><var>:File</var><code>)</code><dt><code>reconsult(</code><var>:File</var><code>)</code><dd>loads source file into interpreted representation.

     <br><dt><code>ensure_loaded(</code><var>:File</var><code>)</code><dd>loads a source and PO file, whichever is more recent, unless the file
has already been loaded and it has not been modified since it was
loaded. 
</dl>

   <p>The following notes apply to all the Load Predicates:

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>The <var>File</var> argument must be one of the following:

          <ul>
<li>an atom that is the name of a file containing Prolog code; a `<samp><span class="samp">.pro</span></samp>',
`<samp><span class="samp">.pl</span></samp>' or a
`<samp><span class="samp">.po</span></samp>' suffix to a filename may be omitted (see <a href="ref_002dfdi_002dfsp.html#ref_002dfdi_002dfsp">ref-fdi-fsp</a>)
<li>a list of any atom listed above;
<li>the atom <code>user</code>
</ul>

     <li>These predicates resolve relative file names in the same way as
<code>absolute_file_name/2</code>.  For information on file names refer
to <a href="ref_002dfdi.html#ref_002dfdi">ref-fdi</a>.

     <li><a name="index-fileerrors-_0028prolog-flag_0029-599"></a>The above predicates raise an exception if any of the files named in
<var>File</var> does not exist, unless the <code>fileerrors</code> flag is set to
<code>off</code>.

     <p>Errors detected during compilation, such as an attempt to redefine a built-in
predicate, also cause exceptions to be raised.  However, these exceptions are
caught by the compiler, and an appropriate error message is printed.

     <li>There are a number of <dfn>style warnings</dfn> that may appear when a file
is compiled.  These are designed to aid in catching simple errors in
your programs and are initially <code>on</code>, but can be turned
<code>off</code> if desired by setting the appropriate flags, which are:

          <dl>
<dt><code>single_var_warnings</code><dd><a name="index-single_005fvar_005fwarnings-_0028prolog-flag_0029-600"></a>If <code>on</code>, warnings are printed when a <var>sentence</var>
(see <a href="ref_002dsyn_002dsyn_002dsen.html#ref_002dsyn_002dsyn_002dsen">ref-syn-syn-sen</a>) containing variables not beginning with
`<samp><span class="samp">_</span></samp>' occurring once only is compiled or consulted.

          <br><dt><code>redefine_warnings</code><dd><a name="index-redefine_005fwarnings-_0028prolog-flag_0029-601"></a>If <code>on</code>, warnings are printed when:

               <ul>
<li>a module or predicate is being redefined from a different
file than its previous definition. 
<li>a predicate is being
imported whilst it was locally defined already. 
<li>a predicate is being
redefined locally whilst it was imported already. 
<li>a predicate is being
imported whilst it was imported from another module already. 
</ul>

          <br><dt><code>discontiguous_warnings</code><dd><a name="index-discontiguous_005fwarnings-_0028prolog-flag_0029-602"></a>If <code>on</code>, warnings are printed when clauses are not together in
source files, and the relevant predicate has not been declared
<code>discontiguous</code>. 
</dl>

     <li>By default, all clauses for a predicate are required to come from just
one file.  A predicate must be declared <code>multifile</code> if its clauses
are to be spread across several different files.  See the reference
page for <code>multifile/1</code>.

     <li>If a file being loaded is not a module-file, all the predicates
defined in the file are loaded into the source module.  The form
<code>load_files(Module:File)</code> can be used to load the file into the
specified module.  See <a href="ref_002dmod_002ddef.html#ref_002dmod_002ddef">ref-mod-def</a>, for information about
module-files.  If a file being loaded <em>is</em> a module-file, it is
first loaded in the normal way, the source module imports all the
public predicates of the module-file except for <code>use_module/[1,2,3]</code> and
<code>load_files/[1,2]</code> if you specify an import list.

     <li>If there are any directives in the file being loaded, that
is, any terms with principal functor <code>:-/1</code> or <code>?-/1</code>,
these are executed as they are encountered. 
Only the
first solution of directives is produced, and variable
bindings are not displayed.  Directives that fail or raise
exceptions give rise to warning or error messages, but do not terminate
the load.  However, these warning or error messages can be
intercepted by the hook <code>user:portray_message/2</code>, which can
call <code>abort/0</code> to terminate the load, if that is the desired
behavior.

     <li>A common type of
directive to have in a file is one that loads another
file, such as
     <pre class="example">           :- [otherfile].
     </pre>
     <p>In this case, if otherfile is a
relative filename it is resolved with respect to the directory
containing the file that is being loaded, not the current working
directory of the Prolog system.

     <p><a name="index-directives_002c-in-files-being-compiled-603"></a>Any legal Prolog goal may be included as a directive. 
There is no difference between a `<samp><span class="samp">:-/1</span></samp>' and a `<samp><span class="samp">?-/1</span></samp>'
goal in a file being compiled.

     <li>If <var>File</var> is the atom <code>user</code>, or <var>File</var> is a list, and
during loading of the list <code>user</code> is encountered, procedures are to
be typed directly into Prolog from <code>user_input</code>, e.g. the terminal. 
A special prompt,
`<samp><span class="samp">| </span></samp>', is displayed at the beginning of every new clause entered
from the terminal.  Continuation lines of clauses typed at the
terminal are preceded by a prompt of five spaces.  When all clauses
have been typed in, the last should be followed by an end-of-file character, or
the atom <code>end_of_file</code> followed by a full-stop.

     <li>During loading of source code, all terms being read in are subject to
term expansion.  Grammar rules is a special, built-in case of this
mechanism.  By defining the hook predicates
<code>user:term_expansion/6</code> and <code>goal_expansion/5</code>, you can
specify any desired transformation to be done as clauses are loaded.

     <li>The current load context (module, file, stream, directory) can be
queried using <code>prolog_load_context/2</code>.

     <li>Predicates loading source code are affected by the
character-conversion mapping, cf. <code>char_conversion/2</code>.
