<h5 class="subsubsection">10.34.9.6 Execution of Propagating Indexicals</h5>

<p>Consider the definition of a constraint C containing a
propagating indexical <code>X in R</code>.  Let
\TV(X,C,S) denote the set of values for X that can make
C true in some ground extension of the store S. 
Then the indexical should obey the following coding rules:

     <ul>
<li>all arguments of C except X should occur in R
<li>if R is ground in S, S(R) = \TV(X,C,S)
</ul>

   <p>If the coding rules are observed, S(R) can be proven to contain
\TV(X,C,S) for all stores in which R is monotone.  Hence
it is natural for the implementation to wait until R becomes
monotone before admitting the propagating indexical for execution.  The
execution of <code>X in R</code> thus involves the following:

     <ul>
<li>If D(X,S) is disjoint from S(R), a contradiction is detected.

     <li>If D(X,S) is contained in S(R), D(X,S) does not
contain any values known to be incompatible with C, and the
indexical suspends, unless R is ground in S, in
which case C is detected as entailed.

     <li>Otherwise, D(X,S) contains some values that are known to be
incompatible with C.  Hence, <code>X::S(R)</code> is
added to the store (X is <dfn>pruned</dfn>), and the indexical
suspends, unless R is ground in S, in which case
C is detected as entailed. 
</ul>

   <p>A propagating indexical is scheduled for execution as follows:

     <ul>
<li>it is evaluated initially as soon as it has become monotone
<li>it is re-evaluated when one of the following conditions occurs:
          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>the domain of a variable Y that occurs as <code>dom(Y)</code>
      or <code>card(Y)</code> in R has been updated
<li>the lower bound of a variable Y that occurs as <code>min(Y)</code>
      in R has been updated
<li>the upper bound of a variable Y that occurs as <code>max(Y)</code>
      in R has been updated
          </ol>
</ul>
