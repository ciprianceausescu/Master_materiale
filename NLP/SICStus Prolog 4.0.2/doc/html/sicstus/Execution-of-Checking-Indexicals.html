<h5 class="subsubsection">10.34.9.7 Execution of Checking Indexicals</h5>

<p>Consider the definition of a constraint C containing a checking
indexical <code>X in R</code>.  Let \FV(X,C,S) denote the
set of values for X that can make C false in some
ground extension of the store S.  Then the indexical should
obey the following coding rules:

     <ul>
<li>all arguments of C except X should occur in R
<li>if R is ground in S, S(R) = \TV(X,C,S)
</ul>

   <p>If the coding rules are observed, S(R) can be proven to exclude
\FV(X,C,S) for all stores in which R is anti-monotone. 
Hence it is natural for the implementation to wait until R
becomes anti-monotone before admitting the checking indexical for
execution.  The execution of <code>X in R</code> thus involves
the following:

     <ul>
<li>If D(X,S) is contained in S(R), none of the possible values for
X can make C false, and so C is detected as entailed.

     <li>Otherwise, if D(X,S) is disjoint from S(R) and R is
ground in S, all possible values for X will make
C false, and so C is detected as disentailed.

     <li>Otherwise, D(X,S) contains some values that could make C true
and some that could make C false, and the indexical suspends. 
</ul>

   <p>A checking indexical is scheduled for execution as follows:

     <ul>
<li>it is evaluated initially as soon as it has become anti-monotone
<li>it is re-evaluated when one of the following conditions occurs:
          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>the domain of X has been pruned, or X has been assigned
<li>the domain of a variable Y that occurs as <code>dom(Y)</code>
      or <code>card(Y)</code> in R has been pruned
<li>the lower bound of a variable Y that occurs as <code>min(Y)</code>
      in R has been increased
<li>the upper bound of a variable Y that occurs as <code>max(Y)</code>
      in R has been decreased
          </ol>
</ul>
