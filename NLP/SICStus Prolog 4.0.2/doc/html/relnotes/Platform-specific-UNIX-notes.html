<h3 class="section">3.2 Platform Specific Notes</h3>

<p>This section contains some installation notes that are platform
specific under UNIX.

     <dl>
<dt><strong>Solaris SPARC 64-bit</strong><dd>You cannot install (or build) the 64 bit version of SICStus using
<samp><span class="command">gcc 2.x</span></samp>. You need to use the Sun Workshop/Forte compiler,
version 5.0 or later. <code>InstallSICStus</code> will try to find it during
installation but if that fails, you can set the environment variable
<samp><span class="env">CC</span></samp> to e.g. <samp><span class="file">/opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc</span></samp> before invoking
<code>InstallSICStus</code>. Using <samp><span class="command">gcc 3.x</span></samp> does seem to work but
has not yet received much testing. To install with <samp><span class="command">gcc 3.x</span></samp>,
set the environment variable <samp><span class="env">CC</span></samp> appropriately before invoking
<code>InstallSICStus</code>.

     <p>The following libraries are not supported: <code>library(bdb)</code>,
<code>library(tcltk)</code>.

     <br><dt><strong>Solaris 8</strong><dd>Library <code>timeout</code> does not work with the default thread
implementation in Solaris 8. Instead the &ldquo;Alternate Thread Library (T2)&rdquo;
must be used. This is ensured automatically for executables built with
the <samp><span class="command">spld</span></samp> tool. See
<a href="http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/alt_thread_lib.html">http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/alt_thread_lib.html</a>
for further information.

     <p>This problem does not affect Solaris 9 or later.

     <!-- @ifset MACOSXSUPPORTED -->
<br><dt><strong>Mac OS X</strong><dd><!-- [PD] 4.0.0 On Mac OS X 10.4 Tcl/Tk is installed by default. -->
<!-- Installing and using @code{library(tcltk)} requires @code{Tk}, which is -->
<!-- not installed under Mac OS X by default (@pxref{Tcl/Tk Notes}). -->

     <p>An executable built with <samp><span class="command">spld</span></samp> will only work if there is a
properly configured subdirectory <samp><span class="file">sp-4.0.2</span></samp> in the
same directory as the executable; see <a href="../sicstus/Runtime-Systems-on-UNIX-Target-Machines.html#Runtime-Systems-on-UNIX-Target-Machines">Runtime Systems on UNIX Target Machines</a>.

     <p>Alternatively, the option <samp><span class="option">--wrapper</span></samp> can be passed to <samp><span class="command">spld</span></samp>. 
In this case a wrapper script is created that will set up various
environment variables and invoke the real executable.

     <p>When using third-party products like <code>BDB</code>, you may
need to set up <samp><span class="env">DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</span></samp> so that the Mac OS X dynamic
linker can find them. When using the SICStus development executable
(<samp><span class="command">sicstus</span></samp>), this should happen automatically.

     <p>Sometimes, the default limit on the process's data-segment is
unreasonably small, which may lead to unexpected memory allocation
failures. To check this limit, do
     <pre class="example">          tcsh&gt; <kbd>limit data</kbd>
          datasize 	6144 kbytes
          bash&gt; <kbd>ulimit -d</kbd>
          6144
     </pre>
     <p>This indicates that the maximum size of the data-segment is only 6
Mb. To remove the limit, do
     <pre class="example">          tcsh&gt; <kbd>limit datasize unlimited</kbd>
          datasize 	unlimited
          bash&gt; <kbd>ulimit -d unlimited</kbd>
          bash&gt; <kbd>ulimit -d</kbd>
          unlimited
     </pre>
     <!-- [PM] 3.9b4 @strong{Note}: will be mistaken for a cross reference by -->
<!-- Info. See the texinfo documentation for @strong{}. -->
<blockquote>
<strong>Please note</strong>: <samp><span class="command">limit</span></samp> (<samp><span class="command">ulimit</span></samp>) is a shell built-in
in <samp><span class="command">csh</span></samp>/<samp><span class="command">tcsh</span></samp> (<samp><span class="command">sh</span></samp>/<samp><span class="command">bash</span></samp>). It may have a
different name in other shells. 
</blockquote>

     <blockquote>
<strong>Please note</strong>: The limit will also affect SICStus when started
from within Emacs, e.g. with <kbd>M-x run-prolog</kbd>. To change the
limit used by Emacs and its sub-processes (such as SICStus) you will
need to change the limit in the shell used to start Emacs. Alternatively
you can create a shell wrapper for the <samp><span class="command">emacs</span></samp> command. 
</blockquote>

     <p>As of SICStus 4.0.1 SICStus will set the data segment size of itself
according to the value of the environment variable
<samp><span class="env">SP_ULIMIT_DATA_SEGMENT_SIZE</span></samp>. If you set this variable in the
initialization file for your shell you do not have to use the
<samp><span class="command">ulimit</span></samp> command.

     <p><code>library(timeout)</code> does not work reliably when Mac OS X runs on a
multi-CPU machine. In particular, timeouts tend to happen much later than
they should. This is caused by an OS bug. One workaround is to disable
all but one CPU using the &ldquo;Processor&rdquo; control in the &ldquo;System
Preferences&rdquo; or the <samp><span class="command">hwprefs</span></samp> command. These utilities are part
of &ldquo;CHUD&rdquo; which can be installed as part of Apple XCode. The
underlying bug is related to <code>setitimer(ITIMER_VIRTUAL)</code> and has
been observed at least up to Mac OS X 10.4.8 (Darwin 8.8.1).

     <p>File names are encoded in UTF-8 under Mac OS X. This is
handled correctly by SICStus.

     <p>If SICStus encounters a file name that is not encoded in UTF-8, it
<!-- will interpret the name as Latin 1 (ISO 8859/1) instead. -->
will silently ignore the file or directory. 
This can happen on file systems where files have been created by some
other OS than Mac OS X, e.g. on network file servers accessed by
other UNIX flavors or Windows.

     <p>The default character encoding for the SICStus standard streams is
based on the current locale which is POSIX/C, i.e. US ASCII, by
default on Mac OS X. 
<!-- (@pxref{WCX Environment Variables, , WCX Environment Variables, sicstus, the SICStus Prolog Manual}). -->
This will come in
conflict with the default character encoding for the Terminal
application which is UTF-8. A clickable launcher for SICStus is
optionally installed in the Applications folder. This launcher will set
the character encoding of the standard streams to UTF-8 for both the
Terminal and SICStus.

     <p>The SICStus binaries are not built as universal binaries, and neither
<samp><span class="command">spld</span></samp> nor <samp><span class="command">splfr</span></samp> supports building universal
binaries. You can however build a universal binary of your SICStus
application by running <samp><span class="command">spld</span></samp> from a SICStus
PowerPC-installation (this may be done on an Intel-Mac using Rosetta)
and running <samp><span class="command">spld</span></samp> from a SICStus Intel-installation, and then
joining the two generated binaries with <samp><span class="command">lipo</span></samp>. The following example
assumes that your program is in <samp><span class="file">myprog.pl</span></samp> and the paths to your
PowerPC-installation and your Intel-installation are
<samp><span class="env">SP-i386-BINPATH</span></samp> and <samp><span class="env">SP-PPC-BINPATH</span></samp> respectively.
     <pre class="example">          $(SP-i386-BINPATH)/sicstus -l myprog.pl --goal "save_program(myprog), halt."
          $(SP-i386-BINPATH)/spld --main=restore myprog.sav -static -o myprog-i386
          $(SP-PPC-BINPATH)/spld --main=restore myprog.sav -static -o myprog-ppc
          lipo myprog-i386 myprog-ppc -create -output myprog
     </pre>
     <p>You cannot install a PowerPC-based SICStus on an Intel-Mac with the
SICStus Installer Tool. You must unpack the tar file and run the
script InstallSICStus with the <samp><span class="option">--all-questions</span></samp>
argument. When asked if you want to install the prebuilt version
of SICStus, answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.

     <br><dt><dd><strong>Mac OS X 64-bit</strong>
The following libraries are not supported: <code>library(bdb)</code>,
<code>library(tcltk)</code>.

     <!-- @end ifset MACOSXSUPPORTED -->
<!-- @item @strong{irix} -->
<!-- @code{spld -moveable} implies @option{-wrapper}. this is due to -->
<!-- limitations in the irix run-time loader. -->
<!-- @item @strong{irix} -->
<!-- pre-linked dynamic resources will not be found at run-time if the -->
<!-- executable was built with @code{spld -moveable}. this should not be a -->
<!-- problem; pre-linked dynamic resources are not recommended anyway. -->
<!-- @item @strong{aix} -->
<!-- applications that embed the sicstus run-time need to use the @samp{large -->
<!-- address-space model}. this is done automatically by @command{spld}. if you -->
<!-- do not use @command{spld}, you need to set this option yourself. this is -->
<!-- achieved by linking the executable using the @option{-bmaxdata} option. an -->
<!-- alternative may be to set the environment variable @env{ldr_cntrl} -->
<!-- appropriately. see the documentation for the aix command @command{ld}. -->
<!-- @item AIX -->
